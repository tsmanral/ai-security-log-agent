"""
Bounded sliding-window rate limiter (§6 #5).

The previous per-endpoint rate limiters used an unbounded ``defaultdict`` keyed
by device_id / client IP, so every distinct — including dead or spoofed —
identifier added a permanent entry: a slow memory-exhaustion vector. This
limiter keeps at most ``max_keys`` windows (LRU eviction) and opportunistically
drops idle keys whose window has fully aged out.

Not thread-safe on its own; callers touch it synchronously under the FastAPI
event loop, which is sufficient here. Persistence is descoped to M1.
