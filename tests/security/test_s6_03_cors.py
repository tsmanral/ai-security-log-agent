"""
LSADRA security regression — §6 #3: CORS wildcard + credentials.

Attacker story: with ``allow_origins=["*"]`` AND ``allow_credentials=True``, any
website could make credentialed cross-origin requests to the API and read the
responses — a classic CORS misconfiguration (browsers reflect the caller's
Origin when credentials are combined with a wildcard). The fix drops
credentialed CORS entirely (agents use header-token auth, not browser cookies)
and restricts origins to an env-driven allowlist that is empty by default.

Behavior is asserted via Starlette's CORSMiddleware through the test client. On
the pre-fix config a disallowed Origin is reflected back with credentials;
post-fix it is not — so these assertions fail on the pre-fix code path.

Synthetic origins only.
