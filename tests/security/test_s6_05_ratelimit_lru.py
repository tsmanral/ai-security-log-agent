"""
LSADRA security regression — §6 #5: unbounded rate-limit keys.

Attacker story: the per-device / per-IP rate limiters kept one window per
distinct identifier in an unbounded dict. An attacker cycling through millions
of spoofed device IDs (or source IPs) forced unbounded memory growth — a
denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. The fix caps tracked keys with an LRU
and evicts idle keys, while still enforcing the per-window request limit.

Pre-fix there is no bounded limiter (import fails / growth is unbounded); these
assertions pin the bounded behavior.
